# Beginner Git commands

The basic steps you need in the beginning are:

- Download and setup Git (one time ony)
- Create an empty repo on GitHub
- Initialize Git in a project folder
- Make changes or create a file
- Add the changes to staging then commit the changes
- Push your changes or project files to your empty repo


If you created any files on Github, then you will have to use `git pull` before you can do a `git push`. So in the beginning, don't create any files on GitHub.

## Download and setup Git

It's been well over a year since I did this so I can't remember all the steps. But first, you need to [download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads 'Git download page').

Check out this video from the YouTube channel LearnWebCode: [Git Tutorial Part 3: Installation, Command-line & Clone](https://youtu.be/UFEby2zo-9E 'Git Tutorial'). I followed his steps to run the `config` commands below. Follow his instructions using Git Bash. Eventually, you will use VS Code for 99% of the commands in this guide.

**Note**: On your first push ever to GitHub, you will need to provide a `user name` and `email address` to git, the ones used when you created your GitHub account. This is so git knows that you are who you say you are. 

Ater downloading Git, open the `.exe` file in your downloads folder. Then find Git Bash and open it. For me on Windows, there was a Git folder in my Start ment and Git bash was in there. Open it and in the command prompt that opens enter the following commands:

```
git config --global user.name "Github user name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@somewhere.com"
```

The `git config` command is used initially to configure the `user.name` and `user.email` fields. This specifies what email and username will be used from a local repository.

The `--global` flag tells Git that you're going to use the email above for all repos on your computer. Replace that with `--local` to use different emails for different repos.

Some people mention using an SSH key to validate your identity. I found that a little confusing so I prefer the method above.

Also, try the following command to see all the configuration settings:

```
git config --list
```

Run that command and scroll down and look for `user.name="Yourname"` and `user.email="your-email@whatevs.com"`, though until you set those values you either will not see those fields or they will be set to empty strings.

## Pushing your local files to an empty repo

Here are the commands followed by a brief definition. Make sure to know these because they are used for other sections in this file. By the way, you need to make changes to your files or create a file before running `git add .` unless you already have files  in your project folder.

Got to GitHub and create an empty repo, meaning don't initialize it by adding a README file. Then back in Git Bash or VS Code run:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https_url
git push -u origin master
```
**NOTE**: I removed `git` from the commands in all the definition tables to make the table smaller. You should know to add `git` before the main commands (not for the parameters).

| *Basic* Git Commands | Definition |
| :--------------- | :---------- |
| init             | Initiates git tracking |
| status           | Checks the status of your changes/state |
| add .            | Adds ***ALL*** (.) changes to staging |
| commit           | Saves changes to local copy |
| remote add origin | Adds URL as remote repo location |x`
| `branch -M main`   | Changes default branch to 'main' (this is optional) |
| push -u origin main | Push changes to remote |
| push             | Push changes after upstream is set | 
| push origin main | Used for 1st push if `-u` flad was not used |
| `-u`             | Parameter short for `upstream` |
| `upstream`       | the primary *branch* on the original repository; where you cloned the repo from |

The `git init` command creates a new local GIT repository in the directory you ran that command. 

The command `git branch -M main` is optional and I think the flag `-M` means changing the default branch name from master to the name **main**. I trid searching for it and I found that Git has changed the default from `master` to `main` though GitHub still uses `master` by default. It's your choice but if you are just starting out I would say skip that command.

The command `git remote add origin https_url` connects the local repository to a remote server (GitHub repo). `https_url` is the URL that is on the page when you create a new repo. It is also shown whn you click the `Code` button.

The `git push` command is used to send local commits to the master (or main) branch of the remote repository. But to use `git push` in the future you have to set something called an *upstream*, meaning where you want to push it to by default. That is why you use `-u`. The whole command `git push -u origin master` pushes your commits and sets the branch `master` as the origin for the location of `git push` in the future. 

Replace `master` with the branch where you want to push your changes when youâ€™re *not* intending to push to the master branch. 

**NOTE**: When you create an empty repo on GitHub, I believe it's best practice to use the same name on GitHub for the folder of your local copy.

<h3 id="commands-after-initial-push">&#10551; Commands after initial push</h2>

Now your local repo is connected to your remote repo on Github. After making some changes or creating files use:

```
git add .
git status
git commit -m "Created README file"
git push -u origin master
```

**Note**: You need to use `git push -u origin master` for the next commit only after the initial push. After that just use `git push` unless you used `-u` as mentioned above (DOUBLE CHECK THAT). Although I believe you can run `git push origin master` and it won't have a negative effect. 

Also, I use `git status` as a habit to check the status of the files, though that command is not required.

These commands work for me when pushing to a repo I created without a README file. If you have a README file, then you will get an error when trying to push, so you'll have to do a `git pull` command to pull the README to your local repo then you can use `git push`.

Here is a comparison of my commands vs. the commands you see on GitHub when you create an empty repo (there is only 1 difference). I am also tacking on the standard `add`, `commit`, and `push` commands.

Commands in detail:

| Command Description     | My Git commands | GitHub commands | 
| :---------------------- | --------------: | :------------- |
| Initiate tracking       | init            | init           |
| Make changes            | -               | -              |
| Add changes to staging  | add .           | add README.md  |
| Save changes to local   | commit -m "First commit" | commit -m "First commit" |
| Change default branch to main    | -      | branch -M main | 
| Adds url as remote repo | remote add origin https_url | remote add origin https_url |
| Verify repo url         | remote -v       | remote -v      |
| Push changes to remote  | push -u origin master | push -u origin master |
| Make changes            | -               | -              |
| Add changes to staging  | add .           | add .          |
| Saves changes to local  | commit -m "Next commit" | commit -m "Next commit" |
| Push changes to remote  | push -u origin master | push -u origin master |
| Recurring pushes        | push            | push           |

## Branches

Here are common commands you'll often use when working with braches:

```
git branch
git branch -a
git checkout branch_name
git checkout -b new_branch
git merge new_branch
git diff new_branch
```

For my Git journey, I did not create branches until I started contributing for freeCodeCamp. But if you are going to contrinute then you will have to learn about branches. Eventually you will want to create branches for your own projects, but that is not what you will do as a beginner.

New commands in detail:

| *Branch* Git Commands | Definition |
| :-------------------- | :--------- |
| branch                | Shows the branch you are working on |
| branch -a             | Lists all the branch names in your repo |
| checkout branch_name  | Switches to branch_name |
| checkout -b new_branch | Creates then switches to new_branch |
| merge new_branch      | Merges 2 branches locally |
| diff new_branch       | to check the differences between the two before merging |

More commonly you will push the changes to GitHub then make a PR (pull request) if you are contributing. **So make sure you switch from main/master to your branch before doing that!**. 

For a new branch, `git push` won't work because git doesn't know what branch you are pushing to, so run:

```
git push --set-upstream origin branch_name
```
**Note**: Using `--set-upstream` is the same thing as using `-u` in the sections above. Actually, `-u` is short-hand for `--set-upstream`.

**Note**: A PR from your branch to the master branch is a request to have your code merged with the master branch. You can delete your branch when your code/changes are merged.

To delete a branch use `git branch -d branch_name`. If you get this error when trying to delete a branch:

> error: The branch `branch-name` is not fully merged.
> If you are sure you want to delete it, run `git branch -D branch-name`.

It's probably because something in your local branch has not actually made it to the remote repository. To find out what commits have not been merged from your source branch to a target branch run:

```
git log branch_name --not main
```

That will show you what has been changed and what has not been pushed to main, or maybe has not been merged. If you are fine with the differences then replace `-d` with `-D`.

When you create a branch, push the changes, merge it into master, then delete it from GitHub, locally the branch will show when you run `git branch -a` even after you deleted it. To get rid of the local branch use:

```
git fetch -p
```

From freeCodeCamp, here is what the `-p` flag does:

> The `-p` flag means "prune". After fetching, branches which no longer exist on the remote will be deleted.

To pull changes from GitHub to your machine use `git pull origin master` or just `git pull` if you set the upstream already. **Make sure you are on the master branch**. What `git pull` does is merge all the changes present in the remote repository to the local working directory (See the section [Staying up to date](#staying-up-to-date)).

## Clone your own repo

Why would you do this? Use this when you created a repo and added a file on GitHub like a README.md file. Or if for some reason you have a commit and issues history that you want to copy, though who would have that? Regardless, the process is almost identical to cloning a repo that is not yours: 

```
git clone https_url
cd folder_name
git remote -v
git remote add origin https_url
git remote -v
git push -u origin master
```

New commands in detail:

| *Clone* Git Commands | Definition |
| :------------------- | :--------- |
| clone                 | Copies repo at the URL to your machine |
| remote -v             | A check to make sure the URL is correct |
| remote set-url origin | Sets the URL to point towards your Repo |

Like `git init`, the command `git clone` also initiates a git repo for a repo you want to clone, but git is installed in the downloaded/cloned folder, *NOT* in the directory where you ran that command. But both initiate git tracking. 

`git clone` is used on its own or when you Fork a repo and it's best to use this with Git Bash (I think). Use `cd` to switch to that folder (Change Directory). 

Use `git remote -v` to list any remote repositories that you have connected to this repo. That is to check if you are pointing to the cloned URL or the copy of the repo in your account. Did you clone to contribute, or to work on your own version of the repo?

`remote set-url origin` here sets your repo as the source URL as opposed to changing the URL if cloned from a different account (see next section). It's function is similar to `remote add origin` in the first section.

Then make some changes and run the standard commands:

```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git push
```
> Is it `git push` or `git push origin master` or `git push -u origin master`?

That all works for your repos, but eventually you will want to clone, or fork and clone a repo so that you can contribute to it. You will then need to use the `git clone` again, and various `branch` git commands. You will also need to add additional parameters to your git commands (see [Forking and cloning](#forking-and-cloning) section)

**NOTE**: I believe this is an alterate way of initializing a local git repo than what is in the section [Pushing your local files to an empty repo](#pushing-your-local-files-to-an-empty-repo), but I am not certain about that. The differece though is that this method installs git in the cloned file folder and not in the directory where you run `git clone url`, whereas in the section linked above it installs git in that folder.

## Clone an existing repo

For when you want to work on a repo that someone else created. Got to GitHub and create an empty repo, meaning don't initialize it by adding a README file. Then back in Git Bash or VS Code run:

```
git clone https_url
cd folder_name
git remote -v
```

You can also clone a specific branch with:

```
git clone -branch_name https_url
```

The next part is important. Since you did not fork this repo, but instead you want a copy of it to work on for yourself, you need to first push it up to your empty GitHub repo. See the next section for the details on that...

[Back to Top](#back-to-top "Table of contents")

<h3 id="push-the-cloned-files-up-to-your-repo"> &#10551; Push the cloned files up to your repo</h3>

Because you cloned this repo from an existing repo, git will try to push it to its original destination. For example, if you type `git remote -v` you will get the address of the cloned repo where Git thinks you want to push to.

That is fine if you are contributing, otherwise you need to update the address. Copy the **https_url** from the overview page for the repo you created for the clone, then use:

```
git remote set-url origin https_url
git remote -v
```
The `git remote set-url` command here changes an existing remote repository URL from it's original source to whatever you used for `https_url`, which should be your empty repo.

Now git knows that the origin is your repo. Using `git remote -v` again is to check that git is pointing to the desired repo address. 

Then to push the cloned repo files to *your* repo use:

```
git push origin master
```

Where `origin` stands for the address of your repo. You may get prompted for your GitHub username and password (only for your first push). Then after making changes use:

```
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git push -u origin master
```

> Is it `git push` or `git push origin master` or `git push -u origin master`?

# Intermediate Git Commands

From here the commands are a little more involved and are for when you start to contribute to open source projects. 

<p>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ </p>

## Forking and cloning

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Fork</strong>:</dt>
  <dd>Copies the forked repo into your account</dd>
</dl>

To fork a repo, go to the repository main page, then click the `Fork` button to the left of the `Star` button (upper right). I'm going to use the <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp repo</a> as an example. 

After you fork a repo, open up a terminal with Git Bash and navigate to the folder where you want the cloned repo. Then enter the following commands:

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/User_Name/freeCodeCamp
cd folder-name
```

Next, add a remote reference to the main freeCodeCamp repo, or whatever repo you are cloning after forking, then check the configuration:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp.git
git remote -v
```

Then use `git status` and `git checkout main` if not on main. Next:

1. Update your local copy of the freeCodeCamp upstream repository,
1. Hard reset your main branch with the freeCodeCamp main,
1. Push your main branch to your origin to have a clean history on your fork on GitHub,
1. And validate your current main matches the upstream/main by performing a diff:

```
git fetch upstream
git reset --hard upstream/main
git push origin main --force
git diff upstream/main
```

The 1st command is necessary for the clone to fetch the files, the 4th is optional. Use #2 & #3 with caution - read up on them. The commands above are from freeCodeCamp docs.

**NOTE**: `git fetch upstream` is used to fetch all objects from the remote repo that donâ€™t currently reside in the local working directory. You'll also often see`git fetch origin`. `git diff upstream` checks for a difference between a branch and its upstream source.

Finally:

1. Check the branch you are on and switch to main/master if not on that branch, 
1. Create a new branch for your contributions, make your changes then 
1. Check the status, add your changes, check status again, commit the changes, and then push the changes:

```
git branch
git checkout -b fix/something-here
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m "short description"
git push origin fix/something-here
```
New commands in detail:

| *Fork* Commands             | Definition                              |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `--depth=1   `                | Creates a shallow copy of the repo      |
| remote add upstream         | Pull changes from the original repo...  |
| ...                         | &#10551; into the local clone of your fork    |
| fetch upstream              | Update local repo with source repo objects |
| reset --hard upstream/main  | Erases uncommitted changes |
| `--hard`                    | Resets the index and working tree |
| `--force`                   | reserved for a case where you do mean to lose history |
| ...                         | &#10551; use with caution |

**NOTES**:

> `git reset --hard upstream/main` erases any uncommitted changes. This is not a required command used every time you need to push changes to the remote repo - use it wisely and when needed. Or **ONLY** run as part of the original fetch process.

> `git push origin main --force`, you donâ€™t need to add the `--force`. Just doing a regular git push is fine. Or **ONLY** do it on the first push.

> You only use the `--set-upstream` parameter when you need to add **your LOCAL** branch to **your REMOTE** branch. But once the new branch is added to the remote repo, then you donâ€™t need to use `--set-upstream` each time.

MY FINAL COMMANDS (clone, fetch, push):
```
git clone --depth=1 https_url
git remote add upstream https_url
git fetch upstream
git remote -v
git push origin main
```
THEN: create branch, make changes, and push them
```
git checkout -b fix/branch-name
git add .
git commit -m "short description"
git push --set-upstream origin fix/branch-name
```

Use that last `git push` only for the first time, then use `git push origin fix/something-typos`. Here is the last command AFTER you set the upstream:

```
git push origin fix/branch-name
```

If you realize that you need to edit a file or update the commit message after making a commit you can do so after editing the files with:

`git commit --amend`

This will open up a default text editor like `nano` or `vi` where you can edit the commit message title and add/edit the description.

Here is a comparison of  cloning your repo vs. cloning someone else's repo vs. forking then cloning:

| Command Description     | Clone (Yours)    | Clone (Not Yours) | Fork then Clone |
| :---------------------- | :--------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: |
| Fork                    | -                | -                | Click Fork button|
| Copy forked repo        | -                | -                | clone --depth=1 https_url |
| Copy repo at the URL    | clone https_url | clone https_url | -          |
| Switch into cloned folder | cd folder_name | cd folder_name   | cd folder_name
| Verify repo url         | -                | remote -v    | remote -v    |

## GitHub pull request process

After you push your changes, go to your cloned copy of the repo on GitHub. You should see a green button labeled **_Compare & pull request_**. If you do not see it then click the Pull requests link to go to that tab.

Click the "Compare & pull request" button and notice the page title of **_Open a pull request_** and the paragraph in the section below the title saying **_Able to merge. These branches can be automatically merged._**

You can then edit your commit message if need be. In the body of your PR include a more detailed summary of the changes you made and why.

Large repos will have various form fields to fill out. Here is an example of the steps you need to do from freeCodeCamp:

1. Put an `x` in the checkboxes,
1. Remove all the comment fields,
1. You can preview the message if you like,
1. Remove the phrase "Closes #XXXXX"
1. When done, click the green button **_Create pull request_**.

REMEMBER TO USE `fix: what-you-fixed` or `fix(curriculum)` in the PR Title or other prefixes like `feat`, `bug`, `chore`, `revert`, etc. And you can add to those, e.g. `fix(tools)` or `chore(deps)`.

If the PR is meant to address an existing GitHub Issue then, at the end of your PR's description body, use the keyword `Closes` with the issue number: `Closes #123`

Indicate if you have tested on a local copy of the site or not. Here are some of the notes from their PR page:

> This is very important when making changes that are not just edits to text content like documentation or a challenge description. Examples of changes that need local testing include JavaScript, CSS, or HTML which could change the functionality or layout of a page.

[Back to Top](#back-to-top "Table of contents")

<h3 id="pull-request-title">&#10551;    Pull request title</h3>

The convention has the following format:

`<type>([optional scope(s)]): <description>`

For example:

| Type     | When to select                                                             |

**Description:**

Keep it short (less than 30 characters) and simple, you can add more information in the PR description box and comments. Example: `fix(api,client): prevent CORS errors on form submission`.

**QUESTION**: What creates CHANGELOGs? Is it the use of the colon `:`? Learn more:  [Why Use Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#why-use-conventional-commits 'Conventional Commits').

<h3 id="pull-requests-page-notes">&#10551;  Pull request page notes</h3>

Check the values for the fields labeled `base fork` and `head fork`.

1. The `base repository` is the original source, the repo you forked and cloned, the public version.
1. The `head repository` is your local copy of the base repo.

Those fields should be correct but just be aware of the values. You will also see fields labeled just `base` which shows the branch of the original repo that you pushed to, and `compare` which shows the name of the branch you created and pushed.

**Note**: Large repos like the one for freeCodeCamp will have fields created in the pull request text area that I reference in the steps above. A smaller repo that you are contributing to may not have that setup. In the latter case, be as descriptive but concise as possible.

Also, if you scroll further down on the page you will see all the changes you made. And after clicking the "Create pull request" button you will be taken to the source repo showing your pull request, other pull requests, the conversations for each, etc. Also, check the tabs **Checks**, **Files changed** and **Commits**.

<h3 id="replies-to-your-pull-request">&#10551; Replies to your pull request</h3>

> Our moderators will now take a look and leave you feedback. You will get a message when a reviewer for the source repo adds a comment about your pull request...

Regardless, your changes will either be accepted or rejected. When the owner of the repo accepts your changes they will do so by clicking the **Merge pull request** button. If it is your repo you will then see a green button **Confirm merge**.

Then you will get a message that you can delete your local branch - do that.

<h3 id="staying-up-to-date">&#10551; Staying up to date</h3>

Once you are done with your PR and start to work on something else, the repo has most likely had changes by other contributors so your copy is behind. You need to update your local copy of the repo before making new changes:

```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

I actually use `git fetch upstream` to update my local clone. I'm not sure if `git pull upstream master` is better or not. However, I had a PR fail because I was missing a command. `git fetch upstream` will only fetch the git data. To update your main fully, you should:

```
git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```

So run `git merge upstream/master` every time before making your changes and doing a push. That will ensure you always have the latest state of `master` locally.

<h3 id="handling-merge-conflicts">&#10551; Handling merge conflicts</h3>

I'm a little fuzzy on this process.

Read more here: [Conflicts on a pull request](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/docs/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md#making-changes-locally 'Making changes locally').

A merge conflict is when 2 or more people change the same code/content but with different values. However, I don't think a beginner contributor would actually run `git merge branch_name`.

But if you did ad there was a conflict, in VS Code you will see something like:

```git
<<<<<<< HEAD (Current Change)
<p>some change here</p>
=======
<p>different change here</p>
>>>>>>> Branch-Name (Incoming Change)
```

Where `HEAD` is your current branch, usually main/master. Once again, this would only be done by the owner of the repo, but what you would do is:

1. Decide which change you want to keep,
1. Delete EVERYTHING else -> the change you don't want and the equal, less than, and greater than signs along with the text like `HEAD` and `Current Change`. Everything other than the actual change that you want.

## Miscellaneous git commands

To have git ignore any files that you do not want to push create a file called `.gitignore` and add the paths and file names for those files:

```
index.html
js/test.js
notes.txt
```

To remove git tracking from a folder use the following command in `git bash` or from the command prompt (it does not work in VS Code):

`rm -rf .git`

Here is an interesting one: `gitk` shows the graphical interface for a local repository.

Here are variations of some of the commands above or common ones you may see:

```
git commit -am "message"
git log
git add -A
git add *.ext
git add filename
git --version
git rm â€“cached filename
git merge --abort
git diff filename.ext
git fetch
clear, q, Q, exit, ESC, :WQ, ENTER, pwd (command-line commands)
```

Here are some command prompt commands you may need: `clear`, `q`, `Q`, `exit`, `ESC`, `:WQ`, `ENTER`, `pwd`, <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

I am not sure what these commands do, mostly because I believe these are advanced git commands but I have either used them with help from other people, or they are from my many pages of git notes:

```
git push -f
git reflog
git archive
git prune
git reset
git reset filename.ext
git reset HEAD
git revert id
git config -l
git log --graph --decorate â€“oneline
git stash
git stash pop
git tag
git show
git branch login
git branch -vv
git remote update --prune
git rebase -i
git rebase -i HEAD~n
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good
git config --global core.editor "code â€“wait"
git config --global core.autocrlf true
git command --help
```

Reference logs record everything you do with your local branch. Use `git reflog` to show everything you did in previous steps - find the entry where you think you want to go back to. Then use `git checkout HEAD@{12}` or`git reset HEAD@{3}` to get back to that state, where `HEAD@{12}` and `HEAD@{3}` are just using example numbers. Just run it and you'll see what I mean.

I had to run the following to fix one of my mistakes:

```
git checkout fix/some-branch-name
git fetch upstream
git rebase -i upstream/main
git push -f
```

Is this how you add a description?

```
git commit -m "Title" -m "Description ..........";
```

## Final notes

I may have errors or incorrect usage of commands in this file. I'll fix them as I find them. Or contact me and let me know what needs to be changed at [Kernix Web Design](https://kernixwebdesign.com/contact/ 'Contact page').

I am also looking to find 3-4 entry-level designers and developers to start a project or two. I have some ideas about how we can help each other land a job!

To-Do List:

- What are **Actions**?
- What are **Packages**? NPM packages?
- What are **Environments**?
- What is a **Releases** exactly?
- What exactly do you put on the **Projects** tab?
- Go into your Repo settings and add:
  - Description
  - Website link
  - Topic tags
  - Deselect Releases and Packages if you do not have any

<h3 id="terminology">&#10551; Terminology</h3>

Here are some common terms. These notes are from git, MDN, and other sources:

1. **`upstream`**: the primary *branch* on the original repository; where you cloned the repo from.
1. **`origin`**: The default upstream repository - a reference to the remote repository from where a project was initially cloned.
1. **`remote` / `remote repository`**: the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server (like GitHub), a shared repository that all team members use to exchange their changes.
1. **`fetch`**: adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them.
1. **`pull`**: Pulling a branch means to fetch it and merge it; fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.
1. **`push`**: To send your committed changes to a remote repo, to upload local repo content to a remote repo.
1. **`clone`**: used to make a copy of the target repository; a copy of a repo that lives on your computer.
1. **`merge`**: bring the contents of another branch into the current branch; to take the data created on a separate branch and integrate them into a single branch.
1. **`head`**: A named reference to the commit at the tip of a branch.
1. **`HEAD`**: your current branch, or a defined commit of a branch, usually the most recent commit at the tip of the branch, or refers to the current commit you are viewing. `HEAD` is a reference to one of the heads in your repository.
1. **`blob`**: (Binary Large OBject) Untyped object, e.g. the contents of a file, is the object type used to store the contents of each file in a repository.
