If you are just starting using Git and GitHub then make sure you understand how and when to use the commands in [BEGINNER_GIT.md](https://github.com/Kernix13/beginner-git-commands/blob/master/BEGINNER_GIT.md).

The file [INTERMEDIATE_GIT.md](https://github.com/Kernix13/beginner-git-commands/blob/master/INTERMEDIATE_GIT.md) will be useful when you start creating branches and pushing them to GitHub. That file also has notes on Gists, GitHub pages, and other useful tips.

The file [ADVANCED_GIT.md](https://github.com/Kernix13/beginner-git-commands/blob/master/ADVANCED_GIT.md) has useful notes on forking and cloning a open-soure repository for the purpose of contributing. It includes notes on:

- GitHub Issues
- Pull Requests
- Merge conflicts
- Undoing mistakes
- Detailed notes on specific git commands.

Finally, [details.md](https://github.com/Kernix13/beginner-git-commands/blob/master/details.md) describes the various commands in more detail.

The basic steps you need in the beginning are:

1. Download and install Git (one time ony)
1. Generate an SSH key to authenticate your machine with GitHub
1. Create an empty repo on GitHub
1. Initialize Git in a project folder
1. Make changes or create a file
1. Add the changes to staging
1. Commit the changes
1. Push your changes or project files to your repo

If you created any files on Github, then you will have to use `git pull` before you can do a `git push`. So in the beginning, _don't create any files on GitHub_.
