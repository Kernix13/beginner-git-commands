This repo have the commands a beginner will need to use git, as well as intermediate and advanced commands:

- [BEGINNER_GIT.md](https://github.com/Kernix13/beginner-git-commands/blob/master/BEGINNER_GIT.md) 
- [INTERMEDIATE_GIT.md](https://github.com/Kernix13/beginner-git-commands/blob/master/INTERMEDIATE_GIT.md) 
- [ADVANCED_GIT.md](https://github.com/Kernix13/beginner-git-commands/blob/master/ADVANCED_GIT.md)

The basic steps you need in the beginning are:

1. Download and install Git (one time ony)
1. Create an empty repo on GitHub
1. Initialize Git in a project folder
1. Make changes or create a file
1. Add the changes to staging
1. Commit the changes
1. Push your changes or project files to your repo

If you created any files on Github, then you will have to use `git pull` before you can do a `git push`. So in the beginning, _don't create any files on GitHub_.
