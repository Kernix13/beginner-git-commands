# Basic notes on contributing to open source

> These are hodge-podge notes on contributing to open-source projects on GitHub or other sites.

> **THOUGHTS**: THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU NEED TO SPEND TO FIND SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO IS RIDICULOUS. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GET TO IT BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DOES.

## PR and issues search

You want to search for either a subject or programming language/technology that you feel would work for you.

**TIP 1**: Try searching for `good first issue`

```
is:open is:issue archived:false label:"good first issue" language"javascript"
```

**TIP 2**: Search the project for `To Do` or `ToDo` or `To-Do`- they often get forgotten about

- Check the issues tab – on a repo or the main one on GH – search by specific Labels – like `good first issue` and `javascript`

Here are examples of the search criteria you can use searching for open issues or pull requests:

```
<!-- issues tab -->
is:open is:issue label:question
is:open is:issue label:bug
is:open is:issue label:Content:Accessibility
is:open label:Content:JS

<!-- pull requests tab -->
is:open is:pr label:bug
is:open is:pr label:"good first issue"
is:open is:pr label:Content:CSS
```

## Must have elements in all Open-Source projects

1. License: If a project does not have an open-source license, then it is not open source.
1. README file: lists the requirements for contributing to the project.
1. A good README should contain everything a potential contributor would want to know about the project
1. Contribution Guidelines: These are guidelines that help people who contribute to the project know exactly what is expected from them
1. Code of Conduct: a document that establishes your expectations for how your contributors and participants behave

- [Good First Issues](https://goodfirstissues.com/): looks good

## Final thoughts

What are you supposed to get from this? Job leads, references, bullet points for your resume, experience working on a team, working remotely, using git/GitHub?

> WHY DOESN'T `.prettierignore` WORK?
